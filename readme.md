#Vex

This repository was created to show examples of object-oriented programming in mechatronic applications using the VEX platform.<br/>
The simple line tracker example was developed to teach the 2018-19 FIRST Team 4733 Recruits about sensor interfaces as they developed their own line trackers.<br/>
